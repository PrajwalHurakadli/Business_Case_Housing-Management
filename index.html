            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Affordable housing development is about making sure everyone has a safe and affordable place to live, especially for those with lower incomes. As cities grow, finding housing that doesn't take up too much of a person’s paycheck becomes more important. Governments, private companies, and communities work together to build these homes, often using smart strategies like efficient land use and innovative building methods to keep costs low. The aim is not just to provide a roof over people's heads but to create communities where they have access to jobs, schools, and healthcare, helping them live better, fuller lives.</p>

            <h2>Choosing the Best Locations for New Housing Projects</h2>
            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>How can we identify the best locations for building new affordable housing based on factors such as proximity to amenities, transportation, and land availability?</p>
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Used:</strong> Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</p>
            <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of locations to assess accessibility and optimize location selection for new housing projects.</p>
            <h3>Reason for Solution:</h3>
            <p>The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is effective in calculating all-pairs shortest paths, which helps in evaluating the distance from potential housing sites to important services like transportation hubs and essential amenities.</p>
            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <p>By selecting well-connected locations, we improve the quality of life for residents by reducing transportation costs and ensuring easy access to essential services.</p>
            <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
            <p><strong>O(V³)</strong>, where V is the number of locations. This can be slower for very large cities but is manageable for moderate-sized areas.</p>
            <h3>Space Complexity:</h3>
            <p><strong>O(V²)</strong>, as it requires storing a distance matrix for all pairs of locations.</p>

            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>How can we ensure that all housing units are well-connected within the community, allowing easy access to communal services and neighbors?</p>
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p><strong>Algorithm Used:</strong> BFS (Breadth-First Search)</p>
            <p>BFS is used to explore all reachable housing units, ensuring that they are connected to communal services and other units.</p>
            <h3>Reason for Solution:</h3>
            <p>BFS efficiently explores all housing units in a level-wise manner, making sure that every unit has a clear path to essential services like parks, schools, and hospitals.</p>
            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <p>Improves overall community integration by ensuring that all housing units are accessible, promoting a sense of connectivity and shared access to facilities.</p>
            <h3>Time Complexity:</h3>
            <p><strong>O(V + E)</strong>, where V is the number of housing units and E is the number of connections (roads, pathways, etc.). This makes BFS efficient even for large numbers of units.</p>
